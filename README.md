# Sports Pose Analyzer

## Description

The Sports Pose Analyzer is a Python project designed to analyze the angles between the shoulder, elbow, and wrist during various sports or gym activities. It utilizes basic Python code along with libraries such as OpenCV, MediaPipe, and NumPy to calculate these angles.

## Features

- Detects key points on the human body using the MediaPipe library.
- Calculates the angles between the shoulder, elbow, and wrist based on the detected keypoints.
- Provides real-time visualization of the detected keypoints and calculated angles.
- Supports various sports and gym activities, making it versatile for different use cases.
